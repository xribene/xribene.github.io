Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Audio Information Research Lab at the University of Rochester, NY, USA, under the supervision of Prof. Zhiyao Duan.

I am currently seeking a full-time research scientist position in the industry. 

My research focuses on designing and developing machine learning tools and intelligent agents to enhance music creation and creativity. This includes areas such as natural language processing, automatic music generation, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction. My work has been published in top conferences and journals in the field, such as ISMIR, TISMIR, JAES, and NIME.

When I'm not researching, I am a musician who regularly performs in classical guitar, flute or cajon. I also love playing table tennis, chess and woodworking.
